            <strong>Being a Better Developer: Learning Skills That Aren't On Your Resume</strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            As developers we spend a lot of time chasing technical skills like JavaScript, C++, and Angular. But the reality is that it the skills you have when you get a job are rarely the ones that you will use for your entire tenure. When I evaluate talent, I focus on the skills that don’t go well on a resume: communication, teamwork, estimation, and active listening. In this talk, I’ll delve into why these skills are crucial to being a great developer and how you acquire the skills.

            <strong>The Future is Awesome (and what you can do about it)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            Technology is advancing at a faster rate than society's expectations, and can go from science-fiction to being consumer-available, with very little in the way of discussion in between, but the questions they raise are critically important: What happens when self-driving vehicles cause unemployment, when medical expert systems work on behalf of insurance agencies rather than patients, and weapon platforms make their own lethal decisions?
